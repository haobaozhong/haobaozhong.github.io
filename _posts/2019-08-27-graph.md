### Definition

| A                  | B                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Graph              | G = (V, E), v,w V, (v,w) E                                        |
| directed           | (v, w) is ordered                                                 |
| ajacent            | (v, w)                                                            |
| weight/cost        | edge                                                              |
| path               | w1, w2, ..., wn, length n-1                                       |
| loop               | (v, v)                                                            |
| simple path        | all vertices are distince, except first and last                  |
| cycle              | directed, w1 = wn                                                 |
| DAG                | directed acyclic graph                                            |
| connected          | path from every vertex to other                                   |
| strongly connected | directed                                                          |
| weakly connected   | directed is not strongly connected, underlying graph is connected |
| complete graph     | edge between every vertices pair                                  |

### Representation

| A                 | B                                         | space            | C                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| adjacency matricx | A[u][v] = true/false/weight/Infinite      | O(\|V\| ^2)      | dense: \| E\| = O( \| V \| ^2) |
| adjacency list    | vertex -> a list of all adjacent vertices | O(\|E\| + \|V\|) | sparse: not dense              |

- adjacency lists are the standard way to represent graphs
